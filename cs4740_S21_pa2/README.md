# Docker Autograder

A web app that autogrades a Python subtraction program (i.e., a program that prompts the user for two numbers and prints the difference). This scalable autograder is designed to be ran in a Docker container on AWS ECS. A Bash script tests the submission by running test cases, which includes every combination of -2, 1, 0, 1, and 2.
